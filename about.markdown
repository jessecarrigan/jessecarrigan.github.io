Hi! I'm Jesse Carrigan. With over 14 years of experience in the tech world, I have been a professional nerd for a while. I'm grateful that you took the time to read this.

# My Journey
My interest in software was spurred by what any child of the 1990s was interested in - video games. I wrote a letter to Nintendo as a child (yes, letters were still a thing then) and asked about how to make video games. I got an incredibly nice response explaining the kinds of programming languages that developers used, and recommending focusing on math and science in school.

Eventually, after some forays into being in bands and having some jobs I wasn't incredibly happy with, I went back to school for a computer science degree, and the rest is history.

# Technical Expertise
I have worked in a number of different industries and domains, including consulting, non-profit, startup, and enterprise. I have had a roughly 80/20 focus on backend vs. frontend development. In addition, I have experience in project management and customer-facing technical roles, which has given me a very broad view of the process of software development from multiple perspectives.

I have used many languages and frameworks in my career, and have become productive with a wide variety of technologies. I favor whatever tool is sharpest for the task. I have recently been focusing on JavaScript for both frontend and backend work, with some Python scripts thrown in for good measure.

# Beyond The Code
Outside of my work I tend to be working on multiple side projects and contributing to open source. I also create music and some of my work has been featured on CBS Sports broadcasts like the NFL and NCAA.

# Let's Connect
Look forward to hearing from you out in the interwebs, and thanks for reading.
